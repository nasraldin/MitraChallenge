Coding challenge from Mitra-Intelligence

1. Create a method that, given a list of integers, returns the highest product between 3 of those numbers. Example:
[1, 10, 2, 6, 5, 3] = 300
Please provide tests that show your solution actually works.

2. Alice is 12 and her father is 36. After 12 years her age will be half of her father’s (24, 48). Her brother Tom is 14, it needs him 8 years for his age to be half of his fathers (22, 44). You have two arrays with the same lenght the first one has the ages of the children and the second has the ages of their father’s, return a new array with the time needed for each children to be half of their father’s age. Example: input: [12, 14], [44,44] => output [12, 8]

3. You have an array of integers greater than 10. For each integer you will find the sum of all its digits. If the sum is greater than 10 you will add the digits of the new number and so on until you have a number less than 10. Find the most frequent number of the new array. Example: input: [123, 125013, 30] => Output:3
